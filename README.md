# Kansas City Shuffle

by Nicholaos Mouzourakis

Kansas City Shuffle is a project I took on as mission to make a fun turn-based multiplayer card game with a code base that is as clean and change-resistant as possible. I hope those that have the opportunity to read and execute the code learn from and enjoy it.

Do note, though, that the code may not make sense if you do not understand the rules of the game, which you can learn from the in-game How To Play button.

## Getting Started

Download Unity 2018.2.21 from [here](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive), (newer versions should work too, if you are feeling lucky) install it, and open the root of the repository as a project with the Unity Editor. Open the `Init` scene, and press the Play button at the top of the screen. The game should have no problem running at any resoluton, but may be a bit distorted if the height > width.
