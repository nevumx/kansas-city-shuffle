      TranslatedString: "\u2022 The main goal of the game is to score points by being
        the last player to play a card in a round.\n\u2022 Cards can only be played
        on top of the last card played, based on the direction of play. If the direction
        of play is UP, (<color=#00ff00ff>\u25B2</color>) only a card of higher or
        equal value can be played, and vice-versa when the direction is DOWN. (<color=#00ff00ff>\u25BC</color>)"

        play changing, (<color=#00ff00ff>\u25B2</color>/<color=#00ff00ff>\u25BC</color>)

        re-shuffled into the deck and re-drawn.\n\u2022 <b>All or Nothing Rule:</b>
        Instead of gaining one point per round win, the winning player will receive
        a number of points equal to the size of the Discard Pile."
