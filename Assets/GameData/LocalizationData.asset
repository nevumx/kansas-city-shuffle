      TranslatedString: "\u2022 The main goal of the game is to be the last player
        to play a card; doing so will net you one or more points.\n\u2022 Cards can
        only be played on top of the last card played, based on the direction of play.
        If the direction of play is UP, only a card of higher or equal value can be
        played, and vice-versa when the direction is DOWN.\n\u2022 Playing a card
        with the same value as the last card played will result in the direction of
        play being switched to its opposite.\n\u2022 Players may also play two or
        more cards with the same value to get more cards back from the deck, as long
        as they follow the above rules."
    - StringKey: HOW_TO_PLAY_PAGE_2_TITLE
      TranslatedString: Optional Rules
    - StringKey: HOW_TO_PLAY_PAGE_2_CONTENT
      TranslatedString: "Optional Rules can be accessed by holding down the Play Button.\n\u2022
        Wild Card Rule: Adds a Wildcard Pile between the Deck and the Discard Pile.
        At any point, a player can play a card with the same value as the wildcard,
        even if it is not in line with the direction of play. Doing so will result
        in the direction of play changing, and a new wildcard being selected.\n\u2022
        Elimination Rule: If a player cannot play a card, he is out for the rest of
        the round, and will not be able to score points.\n\u2022 Optional Play Rule:
        A player can choose to forfeit his turn, even if he is otherwise able to play
        a card.\n\u2022 Refill Hand Rule: All players' hands are reshuffled into the
        deck and redrawn at the end of each round."
    - StringKey: HOW_TO_PLAY_PAGE_3_TITLE
      TranslatedString: Optional Rules continued
    - StringKey: HOW_TO_PLAY_PAGE_3_CONTENT
      TranslatedString: "\u2022 All or Nothing Rule: Instead of gaining one point
        per round win, the winning player will receive the number of points equal
        to the size of the Discard Pile.\n\u2022 Max Deviation Rule: Players may only
        play a certain number (Max Deviation Threshold) of cards higher or lower than
        the current card on top of the Discard Pile, depending on the direction of
        play. Example: if the current card on the discard pile is a 5, and the direction
        of play is up, and the max deviation threshold is set to 3, a player can only
        play a 5, 6, or 7.\n\u2022 Lose Best Card Rule: If a player switches the direction
        of play by playing the same-valued card as the last player, they will also
        lose their most advantageous card after the switch. (Example: the card closest
        to King after switching the direction to be up.)"

      TranslatedString: "The direction of play is undecided. (See the <color=#00ff0000>?</color>
        symbol under the deck) Any card may be played. If it is higher than the face-up
        card in the middle of the table, the direction of play will change to UP;

        DOWN. (<color=#00ff0000>\u25BC</color>)"

      TranslatedString: "The direction of play is UP. (See the <color=#00ff0000>\u25B2</color>
        symbol under the deck) You must play a card higher than or equal to the face-up
        card in the middle of the table. If the cards are equal in value, the direction

    - StringKey: NO_CARD_TUTORIAL
      TranslatedString: Unfortunately, you cannot play a card, because you have no
        cards that can be played on the face-up card in the middle of the table with
        the current direction of play. You will be unable to play this turn, and may
        lose this round.
    - StringKey: MULTIPLE_CARD_TUTORIAL
      TranslatedString: You have two or more cards with the same value that can be
        played. If you wish, you may select two or more playable cards of equal value
        and play them as one to get more cards drawn to your hand at the end of the
        turn.
    - StringKey: WILD_CARD_TUTORIAL
      TranslatedString: "You have a card with the same value as the current wildcard.
        You may play this card, but the direction will also switch to its opposite.

    - StringKey: OPTIONAL_PLAY_TUTORIAL
      TranslatedString: Since the Optional Play rule is enabled, you may choose to
        not play a card this turn. However, you will forfeit your turn as if you were
        unable to play a card initially.
    - StringKey: MAX_DEVIATION_TUTORIAL
      TranslatedString: While the Max Deviation rule is enabled, you may only play
        cards whose value is within a certain distance from the face-up card in the
        middle of the table, depending on the Max Deviation Threshold from the Rules
        screen. (Default value is 3)
