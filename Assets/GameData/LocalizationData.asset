      TranslatedString: "\u2022 The main goal of the game is to be the last player
        to play a card; doing so will net you one or more points.\n\u2022 Cards can
        only be played on top of the last card played, based on the direction of play.
        If the direction of play is UP, (<color=lime>\u25B2</color>) only a card of
        higher or equal value can be played, and vice-versa when the direction is
        DOWN. (<color=lime>\u25BC</color>)\n\u2022 Playing a card with the same value
        as the last card played will result in the direction of play being switched
        to its opposite. (<color=lime>\u25B2</color>/<color=lime>\u25BC</color>)\n\u2022
        Players may also play two or more cards with the same value to get more cards
        back from the deck, as long as they follow the above rules."

      TranslatedString: "\u2022 <b>Wild Card Rule:</b> Adds a Wildcard Pile between
        the Deck and the Discard Pile. At any point, a player can play a card with
        the same value as the wildcard, even if it is not in line with the direction
        of play. Doing so will result in the direction of play changing, and a new
        wildcard being selected.\n\u2022 <b>Elimination Rule:</b> If a player cannot
        play a card, he is out for the rest of the round, and will not be able to
        score points.\n\u2022 <b>Optional Play Rule:</b> A player can choose to forfeit
        his turn, even if he is otherwise able to play a card.\n\u2022 <b>Refill Hand
        Rule:</b> All players' hands are reshuffled into the deck and redrawn at the
        end of each round."

    - StringKey: HOW_TO_PLAY_PAGE_3_CONTENT
      TranslatedString: "\u2022 <b>All or Nothing Rule:</b> Instead of gaining one
        point per round win, the winning player will receive the number of points
        equal to the size of the Discard Pile.\n\u2022 <b>Max Deviation Rule:</b>
        Players may only play a certain number (Max Deviation Threshold) of cards
        higher or lower than the current card on top of the Discard Pile, depending
        on the direction of play. Example: if the current card on the discard pile
        is a 5, and the direction of play is up, and the max deviation threshold is
        set to 3, a player can only play a 5, 6, or 7.\n\u2022 <b>Lose Best Card Rule:</b>
        If a player switches the direction of play by playing the same-valued card
        as the last player, they will also lose their most advantageous card after
        the switch. (Example: the card closest to King after switching the direction
        to be up.)"

    - StringKey: NO_CARD_TUTORIAL
      TranslatedString: Unfortunately, you cannot play a card, because you have no
        cards that can be played on the face-up card in the middle of the table with
        the current direction of play. You will be unable to play this turn, and may
        lose this round.
    - StringKey: MULTIPLE_CARD_TUTORIAL
      TranslatedString: You have two or more cards with the same value that can be
        played. If you wish, you may select two or more playable cards of equal value
        and play them as one to get more cards drawn to your hand at the end of the
        turn.

        not play a card this turn. However, you will forfeit your turn as if you were
        unable to play a card initially.
    - StringKey: MAX_DEVIATION_TUTORIAL
      TranslatedString: While the Max Deviation rule is enabled, you may only play
        cards whose value is within a certain distance from the face-up card in the
        middle of the table, depending on the Max Deviation Threshold from the Rules
        screen. (Default value is 3)
