Things to Know Beforehand:
---------------------------

Card Piles:

+---+  +---+  +---+  +---+
|   |  |   |  |   |  |   |
| A |  | B |  | C |  | D |
|   |  |   |  |   |  |   |
+---+  +---+  +---+  +---+

A - Wildcard Pile: Only one card is here at a time, it is called the Wildcard Indicator and it establishes which card number is to be used as the wildcard.
B - Play Pile: This is the main play area of the game where cards are played during a round.
C - Draw Pile: This is where players draw from to add cards to their hand. When this becomes empty, the Discard Pile is immediately re-shuffled back into the Draw Pile
D - Discard Pile: This is where the card stacks that accumulate during a round are put at the end of a round while waiting to be re-shuffled back into the Draw Pile. Wildcard Indicators are also put here once they are no longer valid.

Card Values:

Each card has a value from 1 to 13. Number cards count as their face value, Aces count as 1, Jacks count as 11, Queens count as 12, and Kings count as 13.

Round Structure:

The game is played in rounds. At the end of each round, the last player to put a card onto the Play Pile is the winner or that round and is given a point, signified by taking the top card off of the Play Pile and putting it face down in front of the winning player. Both the Wildcard Indicator and the Play Pile are then put onto the Discard Pile. Generally, the first player to five points wins, but this number can be adjusted based on the length of play desired.

The Direction:

At any time during play, the Direction determines which cards a player is allowed to play from his hand onto the Play Pile. The Direction starts off as being Undecided at the beginning of a round, and remains Undecided until a card is played on top of the Play Pile that is different than the card below it. At that moment, the Direction is decided to be Up or Down. It is Up if the card just placed has a higher value than that below it and Down if the card just placed has a lower value than the one below it. (If the card placed has the same value as the one below it, the Direction remains Undecided) Once a direction is decided, only three types of card can be played:

 - A card with a higher or lower value than the card on the Play Pile, depending on whether the Direction is Up or Down, respectively.
  > This leaves the Direction unchanged, but there is no card that is higher than a king.
 - A card with the same value as the card on the Play Pile.
  > This changes the Direction from Up to Down, or vise-versa.
 - The current Wildcard, as indicated by the Wildcard Indicator.
  > This changes the Direction AND cycles the Wildcard Indicator. (Discard the current Wildcard Indicator and draw a new Wildcard Indicator from the Draw Pile)

Any time a card is being played, it can be grouped with any number of cards from that player's hand that have the same value, and they can all be played at once and are treated as one card with respect to all other rules. However, if there are three of the same value card being played at once, the Wildcard Indicator must be cycled. (Discard the current Wildcard Indicator and draw a new Wildcard Indicator from the Draw Pile) And if four of the same value cards are played, then those all count as putting down a wildcard, and the Wildcard Indicator must be cycled as well. (Note that even though four cards being played at once count as a wildcard, a player cannot play four cards that violate the Direction of play)


To Start:
----------

- The deck is shuffled.

- Each player is drawn a certain number of cards based on how many players are playing:
 - 2 Players: 7 Cards/Player
 - 3 Players: 5 Cards/Player
 - 4 Players: 4 Cards/Player

- One card is drawn from the Draw Pile to the Play Pile to be the first card in play.

- A player is selected to go first by a quick mini-game: players draw cards face-up to see who has the highest; winners who draw play again until one wins. Discard drawn cards afterward.

- That player plays a card and then play continues based on the rules above.

- Every time a card is played, the player who played it picks up a card from the Draw Pile to get the required number of cards into his hand.

- If a player cannot play any cards from his hand, he may pick up a Grace Card from the draw pile. If the player can play that card, he must, otherwise he must discard it. and skip his turn.

- Once all players except the one who last played a card can no longer play any cards, the player who last played a card wins that round, and gets a point as described above.
